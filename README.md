## libreclassdiv
Made for schools in Italy, where often classrooms are divided over 2 different buildings. Usually one of the two building is in a worse condition than the other, and thus a class' schedule should be balanced between the main building and side building. Often, though, it's hard to balance everything by hand, and that's why I'm making this algorithm to hopefully make the distribution of classrooms more fair.

This algo is in early development, and does not currently really work. When completed, it will only work if there are more classroom than classes and several other criteria are met. Do not worry, you do not have to check them yourself, as the `evaluatecompatibility` function takes care of it for you.

If you like this project and have any ideas on how to improve it, open an issue and I'll do my best.

If you have concrete solutions, open a pull request.

Thanks!
