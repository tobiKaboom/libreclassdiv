Simple algorithm created for schools in Italy to provide the bases to distribute classes in classrooms over 2 different buildings.

It essentially handles years in pairs and distributes the same amount of classes in every year in the pair, but can distribute different amount of classes between the 2 pairs of years.

The rest is to be decided manually.

The philosophy is this:

Fifth year should be in the same classroom all week to focus on final exams.

Fourth and third year should be 3 days out of 5 in the building with more classes, which is usually the main building, and usually is generally better than the side one.

Second and first year should be 2 days out of 5 in the main building.


Written in vim :)
